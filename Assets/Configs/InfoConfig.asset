  - Text: One of the most famous expressions that came to us from ancient times is
      "bread and circuses!..."The original meaning of the phrase used by the Roman
      satirical poet Juvenal has changed somewhat, but remains relevant to this day.
      Many centuries ago, some Roman statesmen seized power by bribing the people
      with circus performances and food distributions. What did people do for fun
      in ancient times? After all, it was impossible to fill your whole day exclusively
      with feasts, visits to theaters, gladiatorial arenas and debates on the agora.
      Even such entertainment was available to a small stratum of wealthy citizens.

  - Text: 'As archaeologists have found out, gambling was popular in ancient times.
      During the investigation of the excavations of one of the ancient settlements
      on the territory of the Kerch Peninsula, Bosporan playing chips were found.
      The ancient Greek poet Ovid left references to gambling in his works: "We forget
      ourselves during the game, we open up in passion. Everything in our hearts
      stands out in the palm of your hand, come in." Such games were available to
      different segments of the population. As proof, scientists demonstrate unique
      finds that are stored in the funds of the Kerch Nature Reserve: playing stones,
      dice, chips.'

  - Text: "A cube is an object used for the game of dice, one of the most popular
      since ancient times. The principle of the game is very simple, based on throwing
      dice with numeric symbols on the sides. Count the number of points on the upper
      edges and determine the winner of the circle by the number of points scored.
      At first, the dice were thrown simply with their hands, later they began to
      use a turricula \u2014 a special cup in which the cubes were mixed. Bones were
      made of various materials from simple bone to gold and various minerals. The
      very name \"dice\" indicates what the first dice were originally made of."

  - Text: Dice are found quite often on the territory of the ancient settlements
      of the Bosporus. There are cubes even in burials, obviously even in the afterlife
      the Bosporans planned to play dice. In addition to cubes, archaeologists find
      tokens made of clay, stone, bone or metal. This is another gambling board game.
      Its roots go back to ancient times, chips were found in the Egyptian pyramids,
      the oldest finds date back to 2500 BC. The Greeks believed that this entertainment
      was invented by Palamedes during the ten-year siege of Troy.

  - Text: The antique board game is very similar to modern checkers. The chips were
      placed on a board divided into colored squares. To win, it was necessary to
      surround the opponent's chips, bring him to the state of "fixed stones". Wealthy
      citizens could afford to purchase personal playing boards, while commoners
      used instead a grid drawn on the ground or a clay potsherd.
